Hi! I am Sai Nudurupati. I am a Ph.D. candidate in the department of 
Civil & Environmental Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle. 
I am an Ecohydrologist, with a background in Mechanical Engineering.

I am studying how climate influences vegetation dynamics in semi-arid 
landscapes of southwest United States. I use numerical modeling to 
investigate the influence of terrain characteristics, 
climate, and disturbance (like wildfires and grazing) variability on 
competition between various plant species, and the resulting 
vegetation organization. 

I am a developer of ***[Landlab]( http://landlab.github.io/#/)***, 
an **open-source Python toolkit** used to create land surface models.
*Landlab* is a collaborative effort, geared towards engaging the community
to maintain a repository of tools that help building, coupling,
and exploring 2D numerical models. I have contributed well-documented,
unit-tested, and doc-tested code for ecohydrologic *components*,
*utilities*, and more. I have also developed *tutorials* to
demonstrate model building and application using *Landlab*.
Checkout the following pages;
[papers](https://github.com/landlab/landlab/wiki/Landlab-Papers-and-Presentations),
[workshops](https://github.com/landlab/landlab/wiki/Landlab-Clinics-and-Workshops),
and [tutorials](https://github.com/landlab/landlab/wiki/Tutorials)
to learn more about *Landlab*. I would also recommend checking out
the *Landlab* resources available on ***[Hydroshare](https://www.hydroshare.org/)***.
*Hydroshare* is a web based hydrologic information system
designed for users to share and publish data and models.

Apart from writing code and working with papers, I like playing badminton. 
I also enjoy hiking and biking.
I enjoy watching Cricket (the game) and 
American football (both college and NFL).
