Hi! I am Sai Nudurupati. Thanks for visiting my website.

I am an engineer, numerical modeler, and data scientist. I aim to leverage data
to address challenges in building ecosystem resilience to climate change
and mitigating the effects of extreme events such as floods, wildfires, and droughts.
I am currently working as a Water Resources Engineer at Jacobs, Sacramento, California.
Here at Jacobs, I develop and apply cutting-edge tools to support hydraulic, hydrologic,
and hydrodynamic analyses for local, state, and federal agencies. I previously worked
as a Water Resources Engineer at Resource Management Associates (RMA).
At RMA, I supported 2D and 3D hydrodynamic modeling of riverine, estuarine,
and coastal ecosystems to study marine habitat health and flow dynamics
in the Sacramentoâ€”San Joaquin River Delta, central California.

I completed my Ph.D. in Civil & Environmental Engineering from the University of Washington, Seattle.
During my Ph.D., I studied how climate influences vegetation dynamics in semi-arid 
landscapes of southwest United States. I used numerical modeling to 
investigate the influence of terrain characteristics, 
climate, and disturbance (like wildfires and grazing) variability on 
competition between various plant species, and the resulting 
vegetation organization. Please check my [research](https://saisiddu.github.io/research/) page
for more information.

I am a developer of ***[Landlab]( http://landlab.github.io/#/)***, 
an **open-source Python toolkit** used to create land surface models.
*Landlab* is a collaborative effort, geared towards engaging the community
to maintain a repository of tools that help building, coupling,
and exploring 2D numerical models. I have contributed well-documented,
unit-tested, and doc-tested code for ecohydrologic *components*,
*utilities*, and more. I have also developed *tutorials* to
demonstrate model building and application using *Landlab*.
Checkout the following pages;
[papers](https://github.com/landlab/landlab/wiki/Landlab-Papers-and-Presentations),
[workshops](https://github.com/landlab/landlab/wiki/Landlab-Clinics-and-Workshops),
and [tutorials](https://github.com/landlab/landlab/wiki/Tutorials)
to learn more about *Landlab*. I would also recommend checking out
the *Landlab* resources available on ***[Hydroshare](https://www.hydroshare.org/)***.
*Hydroshare* is a web based hydrologic information system
designed for users to share and publish data and models.

I am a founder and organizer of ***[Scientific Computing Meetup](https://github.com/PuPPy-Python/Scientific_Computing)***.
*Scientific Computing* is a *Special Interest Group* (SIG) of ***[Puget Sound 
Programming Python (PuPPy) meetup](https://www.meetup.com/PSPPython/)***.
We invite speakers for our monthly meetings from diverse backgrounds
to talk about their fun (or serious) projects.

Apart from writing code and reading papers, I like playing badminton. 
I also enjoy hiking and biking.
I enjoy watching Cricket (the game) and 
American football (both college and NFL).
