Hi! I am Sai Nudurupati. I am a Ph.D. candidate in the department of 
Civil & Environmental Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle. 
I am an ecohydrologist, with a background in mechanical engineering. 
I am studying how climate influences vegetation dynamics in semi-arid 
landscapes of southwest United States. I use numerical modeling to 
understand and hypothesize the influence of terrain characteristics, 
climate, and disturbance (like wildfires and grazing) variability on 
competition between various plant species, and the resulting 
vegetation organization. I am a developer of [Landlab]( http://landlab.github.io/#/), 
an open-source Python toolkit that can be used to expedite 
earth-surface model development.

Apart from writing code and reading papers, I like playing badminton. 
I also enjoy hiking and biking. I enjoy watching Cricket (the game)
and American football (both college and NFL).
