My research focuses on investigating the influence 
of terrain characteristics, climate, and disturbance
(like wildfires and grazing) variability on the vegetation
organization, that is a resultant of competition between
various plant species such as trees, shrubs, and grass.
For my study, I have explored semiarid and arid watersheds from
[Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge (SNWR)](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/sevilleta/) near Socorro, New Mexico,
and [Barta Brother Ranch (BBR)](http://snr.unl.edu/aboutus/where/fieldsites/bartabrothersranch.aspx), Nebraska.

My research workflow typically includes the following steps:
* study about the current state of an ecosystem
* visualize the current state by analyzing available observations
* understand the processes involved
* create multi-layered numerical models using ***[Landlab]( http://landlab.github.io/#/)***
* calibrate the model and cross-check model performance with observations
* create hypotheses and employ the models to forecast ecosystem response
* repeat few or all of the above steps -> *'Re'search*

In *Landlab*, earth surface processes are represented as *components*.
To help myself and the community to quickly build ecohydrologic models,
I created the following *Landlab* [*components*](https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#developer-documentation):
[SoilMoisture](https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/landlab.components.soil_moisture.html), 
[Radiation](https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/landlab.components.radiation.html), 
[PotentialEvapotranspiration](https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/landlab.components.pet.html), 
[Vegetation](https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/landlab.components.vegetation_dynamics.html),
and [VegCA](https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/landlab.components.plant_competition_ca.html). 
These *components* can be coupled to build ecosystem models. I present 
few examples below:
- [Vegetation organization in a semiarid ecosystem in central New Mexico](https://saisiddu.github.io/portfolio/Landlab_model_A_CATGraSS/)
- [Influence of topography on vegetation organization in a semiarid ecosystem in central New Mexico](https://saisiddu.github.io/portfolio/topography_model_A_CATGraSS/)
- [Influence of disturbances on shrub invasion of grasslands in arid watersheds.](https://saisiddu.github.io/portfolio/Landlab_model_B_ResourceRedistribution/)
- [Reusing Landlab ecohydrology model with bias corrected data from gridded hydrometeorology products.](https://saisiddu.github.io/portfolio/KI_paper_model_A/)


I have communicated my research through [presentations](https://saisiddu.github.io/talks/)
at various conferences including 
[AGU](https://www.agu.org/) Fall meetings, 
[CSDMS](https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Main_Page) Annual meetings, 
and [CUAHSI](https://www.cuahsi.org/) Biennial meeting, and
 [publications](https://saisiddu.github.io/publications/). 


I would love to discuss more about my research. Please [contact](https://saisiddu.github.io/contact/) me to ask
any questions you may have.
