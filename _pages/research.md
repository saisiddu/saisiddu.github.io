Like I mentioned in the other page, I am investigating the influence 
of terrain characteristics, climate, and disturbance
(like wildfires and grazing) variability on the vegetation
organization, that is a resultant of competition between
various plant species such as trees, shrubs, and grass.
The watersheds I have looked at in the past are from
Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge (SNWR) near Soccorro, New Mexico,
and Bartha Brother Ranch (BBR), Nebraska.

My research workflow typically includes the following steps:
* study about the current state of an ecosystem
* visualize the current state by analyzing available observations
* hypothesize the processes involved
* create numerical models using ***[Landlab]( http://landlab.github.io/#/)***
* analyze the results and cross-check with observations
* repeat few or all of the above steps - > *'Re'search*
