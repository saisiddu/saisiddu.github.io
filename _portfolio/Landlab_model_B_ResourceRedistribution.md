In this work, we investigate the role of disturbances, such as fires and
grazing, on vegetation organization in arid areas characterized with
aeolian sediment transport. We adapted a conceptual cellular automaton
model that couples vegetation states and soil resource level from 
[Ravi et al. (2009)](Ravi, S., & Dâ€™Odorico, P. (2009). Post-fire resource redistribution and fertility island dynamics in shrub encroached desert grasslands: a modeling approach. Landscape Ecology, 24(3), 325-335.).

We demonstrate the application of this model in Landlab in the figure below: 
(a) Ecosystem response to a natural fire regime and minimal grazing:
(i)&(ii) spatial map of modeled vegetation organziation at years 50 & 250 respectively; 
(b) Ecosystem response to a natural fire regime and intense grazing:
(i)&(ii) spatial map of modeled vegetation organziation at years 50 & 250 respectively.
Model predicts that shrubs will dominate under conditions of
intense grazing.
