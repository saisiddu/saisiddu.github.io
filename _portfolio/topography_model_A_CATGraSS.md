This is a continuation to [this](https://saisiddu.github.io/portfolio/Landlab_model_A_CATGraSS/) project.

â€‹Topography plays a commanding role on vegetation patterns. Plant
biomes and biodiversity vary systematically with slope and aspect, 
from shrublands in low desert elevations, to mixed grass/shrublands in 
mid elevations, and forests at high elevations. In this work, 
we demonstrate the application of CATGraSS model, developed 
in Landlab, driven by elevation dependent rainfall pulses and
slope- and aspect-dependent solar radiation, on watersheds with
contrasting topography.
In the figure below, we compare the modeled vegetation organization on
a sloped watershed with respect to a flat watershed in semiarid central New Mexico:
(a) Contrasting biomes observed in (i) flat, and (ii) sloped watersheds;
(b) (i)&(ii) spatial map of modeled vegetation organization on flat watershed at years 400 & 18000 respectively,
(iii) time series of modeled grass, shrub, and tree cover fractions for CATGraSS 
implementation on a flat domain for central New Mexico climatology;
(c) Digital Elevation Model of a sloped watershed used in (d);
(d) (i)&(ii) spatial map of modeled vegetation organization on (c) at years 400 & 18000 respectively,
(iii) time series of modeled grass, shrub, and tree cover fractions for CATGraSS 
implementation on watershed shown in (c).

Observe how trees survive on North Facing Slopes (Figure d(ii)). This is
because of the conserved soil moisture due to reduced total solar radiation.
To further understand the spatial dynamics, I have included the
timeseries of spatial organization of PFTs for:
