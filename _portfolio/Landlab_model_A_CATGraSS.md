Semiarid and desert ecosystems are characterized by patchy and dynamic 
vegetation. â€‹Topography plays a commanding role on vegetation patterns.  
Plant biomes and biodiversity vary systematically with slope and aspect, 
from shrublands in low desert elevations, to mixed grass/shrublands in 
mid elevations, and forests at high elevations. We  investigate the role 
of elevation dependent climatology and aspect on vegetation organization 
in semiarid catchments where elevation and hillslope aspect play a defining 
role on plant types. We use observational and satellite-based and 
numerical modeling using Landlab. We developed the 
Cellular Automaton Tree Grass Simulator CATGraSS [Zhou et al., 2013], 
an ecohydrologic cellular automaton model, now implemented in Landlab. 
The model couples local vegetation dynamics (that simulate biomass production 
based on local soil moisture and evapotranspiration) and plant establishment 
and mortality based on competition for resources and space. This model is 
driven by elevation dependent rainfall pulses and solar radiation. 
An example of CATGraSS model application in Landlab is presented in the 
figure:

implementation on a flat domain for central New Mexico climatology. 
Spatial distributions of plants in model initial condition (c), 
after 1,000 years (d), and year 1,500.  Model shows epochs of shrub 
and grass dominance in the modeled domain, while trees were outcompeted.
