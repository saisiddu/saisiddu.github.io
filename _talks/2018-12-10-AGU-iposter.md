Presented the different ecohydrology models built with Landlab. We looked at few hypotheses exploring the impacts of disturbances such as wildfires and grazing on semiarid ecosystems. I really enjoyed preparing the iPoster. I prefer iPosters as I feel we can convey the scientific information better with GIFs and videos.
