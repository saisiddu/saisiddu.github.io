excerpt: 'In this paper, we present existing ecohydrological modeling capacity of Landlab using examples that couple components for local soil moisture and plant dynamics with spatially explicit cellular automaton (CA) plant establishment, mortality, and disturbances. Using Landlab components with varying complexity, we discuss the role topography plays on plant organization, and contributions of fire and grazing disturbances on the spatial and temporal characteristics of woody plant encroachment (WPE) and savanna dynamics.'

This paper is in preparation. In this paper, we present existing ecohydrological modeling capacity of Landlab using examples that couple components for local soil moisture and plant dynamics with spatially explicit cellular automaton (CA) plant establishment, mortality, and disturbances. Using Landlab components with varying complexity, we discuss the role topography plays on plant organization, and contributions of fire and grazing disturbances on the spatial and temporal characteristics of woody plant encroachment (WPE) and savanna dynamics.
